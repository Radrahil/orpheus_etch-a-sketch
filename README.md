# Etch-A-Sketch for the sprig, Orpheus pico edition

## Why?

The sprig, Orpheus Pico edition had no actual firmware except for the [quicktest](https://github.com/adammakesthingsdev/Orpheus-Pico-Quicktest).
I wanted to make something that I could use on it.

## Controls

- WASD for movement
- I for toggling drawing mode
- J for reset
- K to change drawing color
- L for changing width of cursor

## Notes on Hardware

The Orpheus Pico edition of the Sprig had minimal official documentation.

To understand the hardware layout and pin mappings,
I referenced the KiCad schematics and experimented with low-level control logic.

Adam if you see this please add some more documentation, there's barely anything.
